# Future Works {#future-work}

This research can be continued or extended into these future works:

1. Adding MRO on Arch Linux by downgrading GDAL and Proj or wait until MRO release a new version based on GNU R 3.6.x
2. Adding feature to run benchmark from existing docker container so that there are more flexibility to setup the benchmark process
3. Do benchmark with the same version of system dependencies since in this research the version of system dependencies (e.g. GDAL, PROJ) are not the same.
