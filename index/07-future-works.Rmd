# Future Works {#future-work}

This research can be continued or extended into these future works:

1. Add MRO on Arch Linux by downgrading GDAL and Proj or wait until MRO release a new version based on GNU R 3.6.x
2. Add a feature to run benchmark from existing docker container so that it is more flexibile to setup the benchmark process
3. Do benchmark with the same version of system dependencies since in this research the version of system dependencies (e.g. GDAL, PROJ) are not the same
4. Do more benchmark for non geospatial workflow.
