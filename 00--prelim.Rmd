I would like to say thanks to my God, Allah SWT, without His help and guidance, I will not be able to finish my thesis and my master study. I want to thank my supervisor, Edzer Pebesma, for giving early ideas and feedbacks. I want to thank Daniel Nuest as my co-supervisor, who is constantly supporting me whenever I need and encouraging me to do proper research. Lastly, Roberto Henrique for his valuable feedback on the thesis writing. Thanks also for the whole R and open source community for providing great software and tool and answer for my questions.

I wish to acknowledge the support from my family in Indonesia and especially my wife, Dian Rokhmawati, who is always there for me. I love you. And also my friends in Erasmus Mundus Geotech who is like a family for me.

Lastly, I want to say many thanks for the European Commission for granting me a scholarship which enables me to pursue this masterâ€™s degree and work on this thesis. The scholarship also opens a lot of new doors and experiences for me.
